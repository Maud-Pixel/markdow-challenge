###### A funny story (smaller header)


Tell a short funny story about your life.
    When I was a french teacher, I was in a reunion with my colleguas. But the reunion was so long ! After two ours, an old colleguas said me : "Come, we can go out discretly". Quickly i accepted her proposition. But it was a new big school for me and there are a lot of corridors and floors ... even differents elevators. And there isn't lights it was the evening, in winter. After twenty minutes we was lost in this school. Impossible to go out aniway. So we need to call to the director ... he was in the reunion ... and we not. So he came to get us et we can continue the reunion. Big shame and what a shame !

TL;DR (even smaller header, under funny story)
   My ex-director saw me after I went out discretly during a reunion and he brought me back.
